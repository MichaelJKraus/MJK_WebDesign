                            <p>Tonight is the first study group I have been able to attend. The past few weeks I have not beeen able to attend due to personal obligations I had before I started the course. Before tonight I was reaching out to the team in the Slack Study Group channel. I offered to help people in class while i was not able to attend in person and some had Direct Messaged me for help and suggestions. I like to help other people in the class, it helped to reinforce what I have learned and tested my grasp of the information. The study group was small tonight, just three of us and the teacher. It was good because it gave me dedicated time to work on my pages, help others, and bash ideas around with other students while Jacque helped to clarify some questions we had.</p>

                            <p>Today we finished off the "Restaurante" page before the first break. After the break we began the process of making adjustments to the final projects. It is required we have the following elements incorporated into our pages.Readable code, good file structure, nested code, all links work, bootstrap formatting, responsive site and a media query. We also must heave a GitHub Repo, Navbar, Accordion or thumbnails, at least three pages of content, link to a site I created, at least 4 social media icons, 2 Google Fonts and a contact form. Tonight we crammed out the code and had the teacher available for questions and suggestions. Because I was able to work ahead during the week, I have most of the requirements added already. Another good night!</p>

                            <p>Tonight's lesson at Geekwise was the completion of the Pet Store page and we worked through about half of the "Restaurante" page. More new elements were added, we learned how to create a carousel, tabbed section (it is used in this example to hold the menu) and integration of social media link and icons. A very good class that I will take away from and incorporate what we learned into the completed Pet Store page.</p>

                            <p>Between classes I spent some time to complete what we would be talking about and coding in the next class. It helps to be ahead of the material a bit. I was able to code and format the rest of the page. I am sure it may be a bit different from the example but still holds true to the required elements.</p>

                            <p>The material is pretty intense, so much to learn. Tonight we learned about adding a Jumbotron, adding navigational elements, and started to style what we have already created during the wire-frame and content stage. The pages are starting to take shape. </p>

                            <p>Learning at lightning speed! Tonight's class was jammed packed full of new material and we are learning a lot in a short amount of time. I put in the time between classes every night of the week to learn, research, and apply more. Luckily the teacher is readily available in Slack to answer questions. Thank you Jacque!</p>

                            <p>Tonights class at <b>Geekwise Academy</b> was pretty good. I learned a lot about how Emmet works and how you can wire-frame an entire website using shorthand through the Emmet tool. A few of us have decided to band together and work together as sort of a pseudo programming team. Both team members are smart and we all work together well.</p>

                            <p>As I head to school tonight, I am excited to learn more about using container to format the Pet Store page. I spent time today working on a footer which I believe came out looking pretty nice even though it does not <i>exactly</i> match the example we are supposed to create a copy of. We will see what the teacher says and how they completed the example and I will be able to compare the two.</p>
